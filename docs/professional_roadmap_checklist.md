# Professional BTC Options Agent Enhancement Checklist

This checklist translates the professional upgrade roadmap into trackable tasks. Mark items as complete by replacing the unchecked box (`[ ]`) with a checked box (`[x]`) **and** striking through the task description once all related checks/tests have been executed.

## 1. Data Ingestion & Caching
- [x] ~~Set up Deribit (or chosen provider) API credentials and secrets management~~
- [x] ~~Implement authenticated client with pagination, rate limiting, and schema validation~~
- [ ] Add historical backfill routines and resilient on-disk caching *(on-disk caching in place; historical bootstrapping pending)*

## 2. Inter-Agent Orchestration
- [ ] Refactor queues into typed channels with async producer/consumer scheduling
- [ ] Expose cadence/dependency configuration and health checks

## 3. Volatility Smirk Analytics
- [ ] Extend analytics to compute skew, kurtosis, smile dynamics, and surface fitting
- [ ] Persist intermediate analytics and run statistical validation

## 4. Strategy Engine
- [ ] Design feature store integrating smirk metrics, realized vol, liquidity, and macro inputs
- [ ] Implement modular/ensemble strategy pipeline with explainability outputs

## 5. Risk Management
- [ ] Expand InvestmentTracker into risk engine with Kelly/CVaR sizing, drawdowns, and stress tests
- [ ] Enforce portfolio constraints and generate daily risk reports

## 6. Execution Integration
- [ ] Build exchange adapter (Deribit REST/WebSocket) covering order lifecycle
- [ ] Develop simulated execution layer with latency and slippage modeling

## 7. Backtesting & Evaluation
- [ ] Support walk-forward/regime backtests and benchmark comparisons
- [ ] Produce rich performance analytics and exportable reports/dashboards

## 8. Observability & Alerting
- [ ] Standardize structured logging, metrics, and alert rules for system health
- [ ] Create status dashboard summarizing pipeline health, trades, and risk state

## 9. Configuration, Testing, and CI/CD
- [ ] Redesign configuration management with environment overlays, secrets handling, and schema validation
- [ ] Automate linting, typing, unit/integration tests, and CI pipelines

## 10. Documentation & Packaging
- [ ] Author comprehensive documentation, diagrams, and runbooks
- [ ] Package the project as an installable CLI with Docker support

## Test & Validation Checklist
Record each validation command as you execute it. Strike through the command once it has been run successfully.

- [x] ~~`pytest tests/test_data/test_deribit_client.py -q`~~
- [ ] `ruff check` / `flake8` (or chosen linter)
- [ ] `mypy` / `pyright` (or chosen static type checker)
- [ ] Integration tests / backtest simulations
- [ ] End-to-end smoke test with mock execution

> _Reminder: Only mark items complete after the corresponding implementation is merged and all relevant checks/tests pass._
