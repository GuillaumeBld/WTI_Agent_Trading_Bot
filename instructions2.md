# Step 2: Enhanced Trading Signal Generation and Risk Management ✅

## Overview
In this step, we will:
1. Update our trading strategy to compute a limit price for each signal. ✅
2. Automate signal dispatch so that signals are sent without manual confirmation. ✅
3. Integrate dynamic risk management into our alerts and execution modules. ✅
4. Adjust signal parameters based on both technical indicators and sentiment data. ✅

---

## 2.1. Incorporate Limit Price Calculation in `strategy.py` ✅

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Open `agents/strategy/strategy.py`:** ✅
   - Locate the function responsible for generating trading signals (e.g., `generate_signals(data)`).

2. **Calculate the Limit Price:** ✅
   - Use the current market price to compute a limit price.
   - For example, for a BUY signal, you might set the limit price slightly below the current price (e.g., 0.5% lower) to optimize order entry.
   - For a SELL signal, set it slightly above.
   - **Example Code:**
     ```python
     from datetime import datetime
     from agent_interfaces import TradingSignal  # Our defined Pydantic model

     def generate_signals(data):
         signals = []
         for record in data:
             try:
                 # Parse the record's date; default to now if parsing fails
                 date = datetime.strptime(record.get("Date", ""), "%Y-%m-%d") if record.get("Date") else datetime.now()
             except Exception:
                 date = datetime.now()

             # Assume record has a 'Close' price field
             current_price = float(record.get("Close", 70.0))
             
             # Determine signal type (example: BUY if next period price is higher)
             # Here we just generate a BUY signal for demonstration
             signal_type = "BUY"
             if signal_type == "BUY":
                 limit_price = current_price * 0.995  # 0.5% below current price
             elif signal_type == "SELL":
                 limit_price = current_price * 1.005  # 0.5% above current price
             else:
                 limit_price = current_price

             # Create a TradingSignal instance using our interface
             signal = TradingSignal(
                 date=date,
                 price=round(current_price, 2),
                 signal=1 if signal_type == "BUY" else -1 if signal_type == "SELL" else 0,
                 confidence=0.75,  # This can later be adjusted based on model outputs
                 limit_price=round(limit_price, 2)
             )
             signals.append(signal)
         return signals
     ```
3. **Verify Integration:** ✅
   - Ensure that all modules consuming signals (like `trade_execution.py` and `alerts.py`) are updated to read and use the `limit_price` field.

---

## 2.2. Automate Signal Dispatch in `trading_agent.py` ✅

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Open `agents/trading_agent.py` (or your main orchestration file):** ✅
   - Locate the section where signals are processed and dispatched.

2. **Integrate Auto-Confirmation:** ✅
   - Add a configuration flag (e.g., `auto_confirm`) in `config.json` and load it using your `utils.py`.
   - Update the logic to bypass any manual validation if `auto_confirm` is set to true.
   - **Example Code:**
     ```python
     import json
     from utils import load_config
     from agents.strategy.strategy import generate_signals
     from agents.risk.trade_execution import execute_trades

     def dispatch_signal(signal):
         # This function will actually send the signal (e.g., via Telegram, log it, or execute trade)
         print(f"Dispatching signal: {signal}")

     def main_trading_loop():
         config = load_config("config.json")
         auto_confirm = config.get("auto_confirm", False)

         # Example: Fetch market data (assume data is retrieved from data_fetch module)
         data = ...  # Replace with your data fetching logic

         signals = generate_signals(data)
         for signal in signals:
             if auto_confirm:
                 dispatch_signal(signal)
             else:
                 # Insert manual confirmation logic here
                 user_input = input(f"Confirm signal {signal}? (y/n): ")
                 if user_input.lower() == 'y':
                     dispatch_signal(signal)
                 else:
                     print("Signal skipped.")

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         main_trading_loop()
     ```
3. **Test Auto-Confirmation:** ✅
   - Set `"auto_confirm": true` in your `config.json` file and verify that signals are dispatched automatically without manual input.

---

## 2.3. Integrate Dynamic Risk Management ✅

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Enhance Risk Controls in `alerts.py`:** ✅
   - Update your risk management logic to include dynamic position sizing based on volatility.
   - Use functions like `fetch_wti_atr()` (or compute ATR directly in the module) to adjust the trade parameters.
   - **Example Code in `alerts.py`:**
     ```python
     def calculate_position_size(current_price, account_balance, atr, risk_per_trade=0.02, risk_multiplier=1.5):
         """
         Calculate the position size based on ATR and risk per trade.
         """
         risk_amount = account_balance * risk_per_trade
         position_size = risk_amount / (atr * risk_multiplier)
         return position_size
     ```
2. **Incorporate Sentiment Adjustments:** ✅
   - Optionally, modify the position size further if the sentiment score is particularly strong or weak.
   - **Example Addition:**
     ```python
     def adjust_for_sentiment(position_size, sentiment_score):
         # For instance, reduce position size if sentiment is overly bullish or bearish
         if sentiment_score < 0.4 or sentiment_score > 0.6:
             return position_size * 0.9
         return position_size
     ```
3. **Integrate into `trade_execution.py`:** ✅
   - Ensure the trade execution function retrieves these risk parameters and uses them when submitting orders.
   - Log these values to help with performance analysis later.

---

## 2.4. Testing and Validation ✅

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Unit Tests:** ✅
   - Write unit tests for `strategy.py` to ensure that:
     - Signals are generated correctly.
     - The `limit_price` is computed as expected.
     - The risk management functions return reasonable values.
2. **Integration Testing:** ✅
   - Run the full trading loop (using `main_trading_loop` in `trading_agent.py`) to verify that:
     - Market data is fetched.
     - Signals are automatically dispatched.
     - Orders include the correct limit price and risk adjustments.
3. **Logging:** ✅
   - Check logs to confirm that all steps (signal generation, risk calculation, order execution) are performing as expected.
   - Adjust logging levels in `utils.py` if necessary to capture detailed debug information.

## Summary ✅

Step 2 focuses on:
- Enhancing the trading signals by calculating a dynamic limit price. ✅
- Automating the signal dispatch process through an auto-confirmation flag. ✅
- Integrating dynamic risk management based on volatility (ATR) and sentiment adjustments. ✅
- Testing and validating the modifications to ensure a robust upgrade. ✅

Once you've completed these tasks, your system will produce signals that not only indicate buy/sell decisions but also include precise limit prices and risk-adjusted parameters, paving the way for more reliable execution and better risk-adjusted returns.
