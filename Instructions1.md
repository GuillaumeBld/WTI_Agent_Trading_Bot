Below is a detailed set of instructions for Step 1: "Begin Modularizing Code and Defining Agent Interfaces." This step lays the foundation for the entire upgrade by refactoring the current codebase into clear, modular components and defining formal interfaces for each agent. These instructions include the logic behind the changes, sample code snippets, and a list of required packages.

Step 1: Begin Modularizing Code and Defining Agent Interfaces ✅

1.1. Set Up Your Environment ✅
	1.	Install Required Packages: ✅
	•	Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.
	•	Install the following packages (if not already present):
	•	Pydantic: For data validation and interface definitions.
	•	python-dotenv: To manage environment variables.
	•	Logging: (Python standard library).
	•	Run the following command:

pip install pydantic python-dotenv


	•	If you use a virtual environment, create and activate it:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate



1.2. Define Agent Interfaces ✅
	2.	Create a New File for Agent Interfaces: ✅
	•	In your project directory, create a file named agent_interfaces.py.
	•	This file will contain class definitions that represent the "contracts" for each agent.
	•	Example: Define an interface for a Trading Signal Agent:

# agent_interfaces.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional

class TradingSignal(BaseModel):
    date: datetime
    price: float
    signal: int          # 1 for BUY, -1 for SELL, 0 for HOLD
    confidence: float    # Confidence level (0.0 to 1.0)
    limit_price: Optional[float] = None  # Optional limit price for order execution
    source: str = "default"  # Indicates which agent generated the signal

    class Config:
        # Allow for ORM mode if needed in future integration
        orm_mode = True


	•	Explanation:
This interface standardizes the data structure for trading signals. By using Pydantic, you ensure that any signal created conforms to this schema, simplifying integration with other modules.

	3.	Define Additional Interfaces (Optional): ✅
	•	If needed, define interfaces for other agents such as:
	•	MarketData: For data fetched from Yahoo Finance.
	•	SentimentResult: For output from the sentiment analysis module.
	•	Example for Market Data:

# In agent_interfaces.py
class MarketData(BaseModel):
    date: datetime
    open: float
    high: float
    low: float
    close: float
    volume: int

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True



1.3. Modularize Existing Code ✅
	4.	Identify and Isolate Functional Components: ✅
	•	Review Your Codebase:
Open your current modules (e.g., trading_agent.py, strategy.py, data_fetch.py) and identify blocks of code that perform distinct functions:
	•	Data fetching (market data, news, satellite data)
	•	Technical analysis (indicators computation)
	•	Sentiment analysis
	•	Strategy generation and risk management
	•	Trade execution
	•	Create New Modules for Each Function: ✅
	•	For example, move all market data fetching logic into a new file named data_fetch.py.
	•	Move sentiment analysis code into sentiment_analysis.py.
	•	Place technical indicator computations in indicators.py.
	•	Maintain the trading logic in strategy.py and execution logic in execute.py.
	5.	Refactor Common Utilities: ✅
	•	Create a file named utils.py to consolidate common functions:

# utils.py
import json
import os
import logging
import sqlite3

# Set up basic logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()]
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def load_config(config_path="config.json"):
    with open(config_path, "r") as f:
        return json.load(f)

def get_db_connection(db_path):
    return sqlite3.connect(db_path)


	•	Usage: Replace any inline configuration or database connection code in your modules with calls to these utility functions.

	6.	Integrate Agent Interfaces into Existing Code: ✅
	•	In your strategy module (e.g., strategy.py), update functions that generate signals so that they create instances of TradingSignal instead of raw dictionaries.
	•	Example Update in strategy.py:

# strategy.py
from agent_interfaces import TradingSignal
from datetime import datetime

def generate_signals(data):
    signals = []
    for record in data:
        # Assume record is a dict with 'Date' and 'Close' keys
        try:
            date = datetime.strptime(record.get("Date"), "%Y-%m-%d")
        except Exception:
            date = datetime.now()
        close = float(record.get("Close", 70.0))
        # For demonstration, always generate a BUY signal with a default confidence
        signal = TradingSignal(
            date=date,
            price=round(close, 2),
            signal=1,
            confidence=0.75,
            limit_price=round(close * 0.995, 2)  # For BUY, 0.5% below current price
        )
        signals.append(signal)
    return signals


	•	Explanation:
This ensures every signal adheres to the defined interface, simplifying further integration with execution and logging modules.

1.4. Document the Changes ✅
	7.	Update the README and Developer Docs: ✅
	•	Add a section in your README (or a separate developer guide) describing the new modular structure and the purpose of each agent interface.
	•	Document the expected inputs/outputs for each module. This helps future developers understand how to integrate and extend the system.
	8.	Create a Version Control Commit: ✅
	•	Once the above changes are implemented, commit your changes with a descriptive message:

git add agent_interfaces.py utils.py strategy.py data_fetch.py sentiment_analysis.py indicators.py
git commit -m "Step 1: Modularized code and defined agent interfaces"
