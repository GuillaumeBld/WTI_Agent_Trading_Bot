# Step 5: Execution Optimization and Order Management ✅

In this step, we will enhance the order execution logic to reduce slippage, optimize order placement, and improve overall risk management. This includes using the computed limit price from signals, implementing fallback mechanisms, and integrating dynamic risk controls.

---

## 5.1. Enhance Order Execution Logic in `trade_execution.py` ✅

### 5.1.1. Utilize Limit Price in Order Submission ✅

1. **Locate the Order Submission Function:** ✅
   - Open the file `agents/risk/trade_execution.py`.
   - Identify the function responsible for submitting orders (e.g., `execute_trades()` or similar).

2. **Modify the Function to Use `limit_price`:** ✅
   - Update the order payload to include the `limit_price` field from the trading signal.
   - **Example Snippet:**
     ```python
     def submit_order(signal):
         """
         Submit an order based on the trading signal.
         Uses limit orders if possible, with a fallback to market orders.
         """
         order_details = {
             "order_type": "LIMIT",
             "executed_price": signal["Price"],
             "limit_price": signal["limit_price"],
             "quantity": calculate_quantity(signal),  # Use your risk management logic here
             "time_in_force": "DAY",
         }
         try:
             # Attempt to place a limit order using your broker API (pseudo-code)
             response = broker_api.place_order(order_details)
             logging.info(f"Limit order placed: {order_details}")
             return response
         except Exception as e:
             logging.error(f"Limit order failed: {e}. Switching to market order.")
             # Fallback: convert order to market order
             order_details["order_type"] = "MKT"
             response = broker_api.place_order(order_details)
             logging.info(f"Market order placed as fallback: {order_details}")
             return response
     ```

3. **Implement Fallback Timing Logic (Optional):** ✅
   - Introduce a timeout mechanism:
     ```python
     import time

     def submit_order_with_timeout(signal, timeout=10):
         start_time = time.time()
         order_details = {
             "order_type": "LIMIT",
             "executed_price": signal["Price"],
             "limit_price": signal["limit_price"],
             "quantity": calculate_quantity(signal),
             "time_in_force": "DAY",
         }
         while time.time() - start_time < timeout:
             try:
                 response = broker_api.place_order(order_details)
                 logging.info("Order filled with limit order.")
                 return response
             except Exception as e:
                 logging.warning(f"Order not filled yet: {e}")
                 time.sleep(1)
         # Timeout reached: fallback to market order
         logging.info("Timeout reached, switching to market order.")
         order_details["order_type"] = "MKT"
         response = broker_api.place_order(order_details)
         return response
     ```

---

## 5.2. Integrate Dynamic Risk Management ✅

### 5.2.1. Use ATR and Sentiment to Determine Position Size ✅

1. **Enhance Risk Calculation:** ✅
   - In `agents/risk/alerts.py` or within `trade_execution.py`, add functions to calculate position sizing.
   - **Example Function:**
     ```python
     def calculate_quantity(signal, account_balance=ACCOUNT_BALANCE, atr=None, risk_per_trade=0.02):
         """
         Calculate the number of shares/contracts to trade based on risk parameters.
         Args:
             signal (dict): The trading signal containing price.
             account_balance (float): The current account balance.
             atr (float): Average True Range for the asset.
             risk_per_trade (float): Fraction of account balance to risk per trade.
         Returns:
             float: The calculated quantity to trade.
         """
         if atr is None:
             atr = fetch_wti_atr()  # Ensure ATR is calculated
         risk_amount = account_balance * risk_per_trade
         # For example, if risk_amount / (atr * price) gives quantity
         quantity = risk_amount / (atr * signal["Price"])
         return max(1, round(quantity))
     ```
   - Adjust this logic further by incorporating sentiment adjustments if needed.

2. **Integrate into Order Submission:** ✅
   - Use the above function in the order submission code to dynamically adjust position sizes.

---

## 5.3. Smart Order Routing and Order Splitting (Advanced) ✅

### 5.3.1. Order Splitting for Large Trades ✅
1. **Identify Large Orders:** ✅
   - In your order submission logic, check if the calculated quantity exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 100 units).
2. **Split Orders:** ✅
   - If the threshold is exceeded, split the order into smaller chunks.
   - **Example Snippet:**
     ```python
     def split_order(quantity, max_per_order=50):
         """
         Split a large order into smaller orders.
         """
         orders = []
         while quantity > 0:
             order_qty = min(quantity, max_per_order)
             orders.append(order_qty)
             quantity -= order_qty
         return orders

     # Within your order submission:
     quantity = calculate_quantity(signal)
     order_chunks = split_order(quantity)
     for chunk in order_chunks:
         order_details["quantity"] = chunk
         submit_order_with_timeout(signal)
     ```

### 5.3.2. Implement Smart Order Routing (Optional) ✅
1. **If Trading on Multiple Venues:** ✅
   - Add logic to choose the best venue based on current market data.
   - **Pseudo-code:**
     ```python
     def smart_order_routing(order_details):
         """
         Determine the best venue to execute the order.
         """
         venues = broker_api.get_available_venues()
         best_venue = min(venues, key=lambda v: v.get("spread", float('inf')))
         order_details["venue"] = best_venue["name"]
         return order_details
     ```
2. **Integrate Routing:** ✅
   - Call this function before submitting orders.

---

## 5.4. Testing and Validation ✅

1. **Unit Tests:** ✅
   - Write tests for the order submission functions to simulate both limit and market order scenarios.
   - Test the `calculate_quantity()` function with various inputs.
2. **Integration Tests:** ✅
   - Run a full end-to-end test from signal generation to order execution.
   - Verify that orders are logged correctly with the proper risk parameters.
3. **Logging:** ✅
   - Check that detailed logs are written for each order attempt, fallback, and final execution.
   - Use these logs to fine-tune the timeout and fallback thresholds.

## Summary ✅

Step 5 focuses on:
- Enhancing the order execution process to use the computed `limit_price` and dynamically adjust position sizes. ✅
- Implementing fallback mechanisms (e.g., switching to market orders after a timeout) to ensure orders are executed even if limit orders fail. ✅
- Optionally incorporating order splitting and smart order routing for large orders. ✅
- Thoroughly testing these improvements with unit and integration tests to ensure robust execution and risk management. ✅

Once implemented, this step will optimize trade execution, reduce slippage, and improve overall system performance, leading to better risk-adjusted returns.
