# Step 4: AI Agent Workflows and Meta-Agent Management ✅

In this step, we will set up the framework for dynamic agent management. Our goal is to create a meta-agent manager that can load, evaluate, and select from multiple candidate strategy agents, allowing the system to adapt its trading approach over time. We will also integrate concepts from Archon and OpenManus to inform our design.

---

## 4.1. Overview and Objectives ✅

- **Dynamic Agent Management:** ✅  
  Implement a system that can evaluate different trading strategy agents (e.g., using different ML models, parameter settings, or signal fusion approaches) and select the best performer based on key performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, win rate).

- **Continuous Learning and Optimization:** ✅  
  Set up routines for periodic re-evaluation and retraining of agents to adapt to changing market conditions.

- **Integration of Archon/OpenManus Concepts:** ✅  
  Utilize best practices from these frameworks to design clear interfaces, modular components, and a dashboard for monitoring agent performance.

---

## 4.2. Create the Meta-Agent Manager Module ✅

1. **Create a New Folder for Manager Modules:** ✅  
   - Inside your `agents/` folder, create a new subfolder named `manager/`.

2. **Create `agent_manager.py`:** ✅  
   - In the `agents/manager/` folder, create a file named `agent_manager.py`.
   - This module will contain a `MetaAgentManager` class responsible for loading candidate strategy agents, evaluating them, and selecting the best one.

3. **Define the MetaAgentManager Class:** ✅

   **Example Code:**
   ```python
   # agents/manager/agent_manager.py
   import logging
   from datetime import datetime
   from agents.strategy.strategy import TradingStrategy
   from backtesting.backtest import Backtest

   # Set up logging
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

   class MetaAgentManager:
       """
       MetaAgentManager evaluates and selects the best performing trading agent.
       It loads multiple candidate agents, runs backtests on each using historical data,
       and selects the agent with the highest performance metric (e.g., Sharpe ratio).
       """
       def __init__(self, agents=None):
           # If no candidate agents provided, initialize default candidates.
           if agents is None:
               self.agents = [TradingStrategy(), TradingStrategy()]  # Example: two variants of the same strategy.
           else:
               self.agents = agents
           self.selected_agent = None

       def evaluate_agents(self, historical_data):
           """
           Evaluate each agent using backtesting.
           Returns a dictionary mapping agent names to their performance metric.
           """
           performance_results = {}
           for agent in self.agents:
               # Load or initialize the agent (e.g., load pre-trained model or parameters)
               agent.load_model()
               # Generate signals from historical data
               signals = agent.generate_signals(historical_data)
               
               # Backtest the signals using the Backtest module
               backtester = Backtest()
               performance = backtester.simulate(signals)
               
               # For this example, we assume 'performance' is a dict containing a 'sharpe_ratio' key.
               sharpe = performance.get("sharpe_ratio", 0)
               agent_name = agent.__class__.__name__
               performance_results[agent_name] = sharpe
               logger.info(f"Agent {agent_name} achieved Sharpe Ratio: {sharpe:.2f}")

           return performance_results

       def select_best_agent(self, historical_data):
           """
           Evaluates all candidate agents and selects the one with the highest performance metric.
           Sets self.selected_agent accordingly.
           """
           performance_results = self.evaluate_agents(historical_data)
           if not performance_results:
               logger.error("No performance results obtained.")
               return None
           # Select the agent with the highest Sharpe ratio
           best_agent_name = max(performance_results, key=performance_results.get)
           for agent in self.agents:
               if agent.__class__.__name__ == best_agent_name:
                   self.selected_agent = agent
                   logger.info(f"Selected agent: {best_agent_name}")
                   break
           return self.selected_agent

       def update_agent(self, new_agent):
           """
           Replace one of the candidate agents with a new one.
           """
           self.agents.append(new_agent)
           logger.info(f"New agent {new_agent.__class__.__name__} added to candidates.")

	4.	Integration with the Trading Workflow: ✅
	•	In your main.py or trading_agent.py, import and instantiate MetaAgentManager.
	•	Use historical data (e.g., loaded from CSV or fetched via your data fetch module) to evaluate agents.
	•	Example integration snippet in main.py:

# main.py
from agents.data_fetch.data_fetch import fetch_market_data
from agents.manager.agent_manager import MetaAgentManager
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def main():
    # Fetch historical market data (ensure this returns data in the expected format)
    historical_data = fetch_market_data(days=365, symbol="CL=F")
    if historical_data is None:
        logging.error("Historical data fetch failed.")
        return
    
    # Instantiate the MetaAgentManager with candidate agents
    manager = MetaAgentManager()
    best_agent = manager.select_best_agent(historical_data)
    if best_agent is None:
        logging.error("No best agent selected.")
        return
    
    # Use the selected agent to generate live trading signals
    live_signals = best_agent.generate_signals(historical_data)
    logging.info("Live signals generated:")
    for signal in live_signals:
        logging.info(signal)
    
    # Proceed with trade execution using the selected agent's signals
    # e.g., call trade_execution.execute_trades(live_signals)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()



⸻

4.3. Incorporate Continuous Learning and Agent Updates ✅
	1.	Periodic Evaluation: ✅
	•	In your strategy_manager.py (or within a scheduling job), set up periodic evaluation:
	•	Every defined interval (e.g., once a day or after every N trades), run the meta-agent manager's evaluation routine.
	•	If performance drops below a threshold, trigger retraining or replace the current best agent with a new candidate.
	2.	Integration with Archon/OpenManus Concepts: ✅
	•	If using Archon:
	•	Review Archon's agent-building workflows and integrate its API calls in your agent_manager.py to generate new candidate agents.
	•	For example, create a function that uses Archon to build an updated version of a strategy agent:

def generate_updated_agent():
    # Pseudocode: Call Archon API to generate a new agent configuration.
    new_agent_config = archon_api.generate_agent_config(model="TradingStrategy")
    new_agent = TradingStrategy(**new_agent_config)
    new_agent.load_model()
    return new_agent


	•	Document how these integrations work and update your developer guide accordingly.

⸻

4.4. Testing and Documentation ✅
	1.	Unit and Integration Tests: ✅
	•	Write tests for the MetaAgentManager class to simulate various historical data scenarios.
	•	Verify that the agent selection logic consistently picks the agent with the highest performance metric.
	2.	Documentation: ✅
	•	Update your developer documentation (in docs/) with:
	•	The design and purpose of the meta-agent manager.
	•	How to add new candidate agents.
	•	Instructions on running periodic evaluations and interpreting performance metrics.
	3.	Dashboard Integration (Optional): ✅
	•	Consider integrating a dashboard (e.g., using Streamlit) to visualize performance metrics of candidate agents.
	•	This can be a separate module (e.g., agents/visuals/dashboard.py) that pulls data from your evaluation logs and displays it in real time.

⸻

Packages and Dependencies ✅
	•	Required Packages: ✅
	•	pandas and numpy for data manipulation.
	•	yfinance for fetching market data.
	•	logging (Python standard library) for logging.
	•	sqlite3 (Python standard library) for database interactions.
	•	Any ML packages used in candidate agents (e.g., scikit-learn, transformers if applicable).
	•	Optional: ✅
	•	If integrating Archon, follow Archon's dependency instructions (often included in its requirements.txt).

⸻

Summary ✅

Step 4 builds the foundation for dynamic, AI-driven agent management:
	•	Meta-Agent Manager: A module (agent_manager.py) that evaluates multiple trading agents using historical data and selects the best performer.
	•	Continuous Learning: Set up routines for periodic re-evaluation and potential agent retraining.
	•	Integration Points: Integrate with your main trading workflow in main.py and consider incorporating advanced features from Archon or OpenManus.
	•	Testing & Documentation: Ensure thorough testing of the agent selection process and update developer documentation accordingly.

This completes Step 4. Once implemented, your trading bot will be able to dynamically select and update its trading strategy based on live and historical performance data, leading to a more adaptive and robust system.
