# Step 6: Automation, Monitoring, and Logging

In this step, we will implement automation to run our trading bot continuously, set up centralized logging for troubleshooting and performance tracking, and build a real-time monitoring dashboard. These enhancements will ensure that our system operates smoothly and that any issues or performance deviations are immediately visible.

## 6.1. Automate the Trading Cycle

### 6.1.1. Main Orchestration Loop

1. **Create or Update `main.py`:**
   - This file will serve as the entry point for our automated trading system.
   - The loop will:
     - Fetch market data.
     - Generate trading signals.
     - Execute orders.
     - Update agent performance metrics (if applicable).

2. **Example Main Loop Code:**
   ```python
   # main.py
   import time
   import logging
   from agents.data_fetch.data_fetch import fetch_market_data
   from agents.strategy.strategy import generate_signals
   from agents.risk.trade_execution import submit_order_with_timeout
   from utils import load_config

   # Configure logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")

   def main_trading_loop():
       config = load_config("config.json")
       trading_interval = int(config.get("trading_check_interval_seconds", 1800))  # default: 30 minutes

       while True:
           logging.info("Starting new trading cycle...")
           
           # 1. Fetch market data
           data = fetch_market_data(days=30, symbol="CL=F")
           if data is None:
               logging.error("Failed to fetch market data. Retrying in next cycle.")
           else:
               # 2. Generate trading signals
               signals = generate_signals(data)
               logging.info(f"Generated {len(signals)} signals.")

               # 3. Execute orders for each signal
               for signal in signals:
                   try:
                       response = submit_order_with_timeout(signal)
                       logging.info(f"Order submitted: {response}")
                   except Exception as e:
                       logging.error(f"Order submission error: {e}")
           
           logging.info(f"Sleeping for {trading_interval} seconds before next cycle.")
           time.sleep(trading_interval)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main_trading_loop()

	3.	Deployment Considerations:
	•	For production, consider scheduling the loop using a process manager (e.g., Supervisor or systemd) or container orchestration (e.g., Docker Compose or Kubernetes).

6.2. Centralized Logging

6.2.1. Configure Logging in utils.py
	1.	Centralize Logging Configuration:
	•	Create or update utils.py to include a logging setup that all modules will use.
	•	Example:

# utils.py
import logging
import os

LOG_FILE = os.path.join("logs", "trading_bot.log")

def setup_logging():
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.INFO,
        format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
        handlers=[
            logging.FileHandler(LOG_FILE),
            logging.StreamHandler()
        ]
    )
    return logging.getLogger(__name__)


	2.	Use Consistent Logging:
	•	In every module, import and use the logger from utils.py:

from utils import setup_logging
logger = setup_logging()



6.2.2. Log Aggregation (Optional)
	•	If you require advanced logging and monitoring, consider integrating with an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog.
	•	For a simpler approach, ensure all logs are written to a central log file (as configured above) and use tools like tail -f logs/trading_bot.log to monitor live output.

⸻

6.3. Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

6.3.1. Develop a Streamlit Dashboard
	1.	Create dashboard.py in a visuals/ Folder:
	•	This dashboard will display key metrics like:
	•	Signal generation latency
	•	Order execution quality (e.g., executed vs. limit price)
	•	Overall performance metrics (equity curve, win rate, drawdown)
	•	Example Code:

# visuals/dashboard.py
import streamlit as st
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

def load_trade_history(db_path="data/market_data.db"):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM trade_history", conn)
    conn.close()
    return df

def main():
    st.title("Trading Bot Performance Dashboard")
    st.write("Real-time metrics and logs from the trading system.")

    df_trades = load_trade_history()
    st.subheader("Trade History")
    st.dataframe(df_trades)

    # Plot the equity curve if you have a column for account balance
    if "balance" in df_trades.columns:
        st.subheader("Equity Curve")
        st.line_chart(df_trades["balance"])

    # Add more visualizations as needed, e.g., histograms for latency or distribution of signal confidence
    st.write("Additional metrics can be added here.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


	2.	Run the Dashboard:
	•	Launch the dashboard by running:

streamlit run visuals/dashboard.py


	•	This will provide a web-based interface to monitor your trading bot’s performance.

⸻

6.4. Testing and Validation
	1.	Simulate the Automated Loop:
	•	Run main.py and verify that the trading loop executes, logs are generated, and signals/orders are processed.
	2.	Monitor Logs:
	•	Check the central log file (logs/trading_bot.log) to confirm that all events (data fetch, signal generation, order execution) are being logged.
	3.	Dashboard Feedback:
	•	Use the Streamlit dashboard to visually confirm trade history and other key metrics.
	4.	Iterate:
	•	Based on observations, fine-tune the sleep intervals, logging detail, and error handling.

⸻

Summary

Step 6 ensures that the trading bot operates continuously and reliably with minimal manual intervention. By centralizing logging and building a real-time monitoring dashboard, you can track system performance, quickly diagnose issues, and ensure that automation is working as intended. This setup lays the foundation for robust, production-level operation and easier scalability.
